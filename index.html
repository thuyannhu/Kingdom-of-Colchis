      <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Colchis, one of the smallest Kingdom in the world, is
        located somewhere between Greece and Mongolia. It is seldom visited by
        tourists as the Kingdom only allows 15 visitors per year to avoid
        disrupting the ecosystem.<br />The Kingdom is well known for its
        mountains. The highest summit is the Meije mount (alt. 1998 meters)
        believed to be home of the Ancients, the Gods and Goddesses who are
        keeping watch over the Colchidians.<br />The Kingdom is also well known
        for its skilled artisans. It is the birthplace of what we know today as
        the art of embroidery. Traditionnaly, women embroidered their husband's
        armors in order to bring them luck and protection. Nowadays, this art is
        no longer reserved to women and some even say Colchidian learn to
        embroider before they learn how to walk!
